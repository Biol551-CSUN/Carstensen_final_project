# Carstensen_final_project
This is a new stand-alone public repository for Heather Carstensen's Biol551 Final Project. 

This project works with some previously published data and some newly generated data related to my thesis project. I have used these data to make an Rmarkdown document with multiple output plots and integrating a shiny app.
